      "Once upon a time, at the very edge of a quiet forest, there was a meadow that only the moon could find. It didn’t show up on any map. It simply appeared when the night was calm and the owls spoke softly to one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that meadow lived a unicorn named Lumen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lumen was not the kind of unicorn who liked crowds or parades or people pointing and gasping. His coat was the color of fresh snow, his mane shimmered like threads of silver, and his horn glowed gently—never bright enough to wake anyone, just bright enough to make the dark feel friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night, when the world began to yawn, Lumen would walk along the forest paths and listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened for worries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worries sounded like tiny, invisible rustles—like leaves that couldn’t quite settle. Sometimes they came from foxes who couldn’t find their den, or from squirrels who’d misplaced an acorn, or from a little child in a cottage whose thoughts kept hopping like frogs.\n",

      "*Each boat is a thought,* the quiet feeling seemed to say. *You don’t have to chase them. You can let them drift.*\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "One by one, the boats dimmed, as if they were sailing into a peaceful fog.\n",

      "A neural network is a kind of computer program that learns to make decisions by studying examples—somewhat like how you learn from practice rather than from a list of strict rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1) The big idea (in plain words)\n",
      "Instead of telling a computer:  \n",
      "“If the email contains *this* word and *that* pattern, then it’s spam,”  \n",
      "we show it many examples of emails labeled “spam” or “not spam,” and it learns patterns by itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "A neural network is one of the most common tools for this “learn from examples” approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2) A simple analogy: a team of tiny decision-makers\n",
      "Imagine a big group of tiny helpers. Each helper:\n",
      "- looks at some information,\n",
      "- makes a small “opinion” (a number),\n",
      "- passes it to the next group of helpers.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end, the network combines all those small opinions to make one final answer—like:\n",
      "- “This photo is probably a cat.”\n",
      "- “This message is likely spam.”\n",
      "- “This house price might be around $350,000.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These helpers are called **neurons** (named after brain cells, but they’re just math).\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3) What goes in and what comes out\n",
      "A neural network takes **inputs** (numbers) and produces an **output** (a prediction).\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: recognizing handwritten digits (0–9)\n",
      "- **Input:** the image, turned into numbers (like brightness values for each pixel)\n",
      "- **Output:** 10 numbers representing how likely it is to be each digit  \n",
      "  (highest number = the guess)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4) Layers: input → hidden → output\n",
      "Neural networks are organized in **layers**:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input layer:** receives the raw information (like pixels)\n",
      "2. **Hidden layers:** do the “thinking” by transforming the information\n",
      "3. **Output layer:** produces the final prediction\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hidden” just means it’s in the middle and not directly seen as input or output.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5) The key learning tool: weights (the “importance knobs”)\n",
      "Neurons don’t just pass information along. They apply **weights**, which are numbers that control importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of weights like knobs:\n",
      "- If a weight is large, that input matters a lot.\n",
      "- If a weight is near zero, that input doesn’t matter much.\n",
      "- If a weight is negative, it *reduces* the score.\n",
      "\n",
      "So learning in a neural network mostly means:\n",
      "> **Adjusting lots of weights so the network makes better predictions.**\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6) How learning works (training) with a concrete example\n",
      "Let’s say we’re training a network to recognize cats in pictures.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step A: Show an example\n",
      "You show an image and say the correct label:\n",
      "- Picture: cat  \n",
      "- Correct answer: “cat”\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step B: Make a guess\n",
      "At first, the network guesses poorly:\n",
      "- Guess: “dog” (wrong)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step C: Measure how wrong it was (loss)\n",
      "We compute an error number called **loss**:\n",
      "- High loss = very wrong\n",
      "- Low loss = close to correct\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step D: Adjust the weights to reduce the loss\n",
      "The network tweaks its weights a tiny bit to do better next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing this again and again across many examples is **training**.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7) Why “neural” networks can be powerful\n",
      "They’re good at finding patterns that are hard to write as rules, like:\n",
      "- recognizing faces\n",
      "- understanding speech\n",
      "- translating languages\n",
      "- spotting unusual activity in bank transactions\n",
      "\n",
      "They can combine many small clues:\n",
      "- In a cat photo: fur texture + ear shape + eye placement + whiskers\n",
      "Instead of one single “cat rule.”\n",
      "\n",
      "## 8) A tiny toy example (super simplified)\n",
